# NYC-Taxi-Data-and-Crime-Exploration
R code for analyzing NYC taxi trip data alongside crime statistics to uncover mobility-crime relationships. 

## üìÅ Data Access and Structure
This repository supports the MS Report NYC Taxi Data and Crime Exploration, which focuses on analyzing spatial and temporal relationships between urban mobility and public safety. Due to file size constraints, data access is split between GitHub and Dropbox. 

üîπ GitHub-Hosted Datasets (/data folder)
These smaller datasets are available directly in this repository: 
- MovementData.xlsx: Net movement metrics by location and month
- Population_data.xlsx: Borough-level population estimates
- crime_counts_by_borough_month.xlsx: Aggregated monthly crime counts by borough and crime description
You can view these files in the /data folder

üîπ Dropbox-Hosted Datasets (Full Taxi & Crime Records)
Due to GitHub's file limit, full datasets for the yellow taxi cab trips are hosted externally
- [Download full Excel files](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/mrss9gpi3mgna98h35mvd/AEDUoPpmHZoa_zKQ5yzL4Sk?rlkey=ao9oyapxx583ovkp0v6xrz007&st=byxsi2tb&dl=0)

These include:
- NYC Taxi Trip Data: Raw trip-level records used for spatial joins and movement analysis for each month
- NYPD Crime Complaint Data: Incident-level reports used for temporal and geographic aggregation

All files are read into R using readxl::read_excel() or data.table::fread() depending on format and size. 

## üìÅ R Code
This repository includes modular R scripts for spatial analysis, data merging, and visualization. The code is organized to support reproducible workflows for:
- Mapping taxi zones and census tracts by borough
- Calculating monthly net movement (in/out) by zone
- Merging crime, movement, and population data
- Generating heatmaps of crime occurrences by weekday and hour
- Creating annotated multi-panel plots for borough-level and monthly trends

Each script is commented for clarity and designed to be reusable across boroughs and crime types. Key functions include:
- NYCCrimeData_Census Tract Zone Overlay(): Generates spatial overlays of taxi zones and census tracts
- NYCCrimeData_Combined Visual(): Builds weekday-hour heatmaps for selected offenses
- NYCCrimeData_Correlation Plots(): Generates scatter plots of crime counts vs. movement/population metrics for a given borough and month
- NYCCrimeData_Combining Plots(): Computes zone-level net movement for each month and visualizes spatial trends using color-coded maps and ranked labels
- NYCCrimeData_Data Processing(): 

To run the analysis, ensure the required packages are installed and update file paths as needed. All visual outputs are saved as PDFs for easy sharing and review.
